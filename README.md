### **Objective:** 
To analyze customer spending behavior at a mall and segment customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing strategies.

### Project Overview

Understanding customer behavior is key to driving sales and revenue. This project applies K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score, helping businesses personalize marketing strategies and optimize sales performance.

### Key Findings

Using K-Means clustering, we identified distinct customer segments, allowing businesses to tailor marketing efforts effectively.

**1. Customer Segments Identified**

- **Cluster 1 - High Income, High Spending (Premium Shoppers):**
  Customers with high purchasing power and frequent mall visits.
  Ideal for exclusive offers, luxury brand promotions, and VIP memberships.

- **Cluster 2 - High Income, Low Spending (Cautious Spenders):**
  Wealthy customers who spend conservatively.
  Require targeted incentives such as loyalty programs to increase spending.

- **Cluster 3 - Low Income, High Spending (Impulse Buyers):**
  Customers with lower earnings but a high tendency to spend.
  Suitable for promotional discounts and budget-friendly product offerings.

- **Cluster 4 - Low Income, Low Spending (Minimal Shoppers):**
  Customers with limited purchasing power and spending habits.
  May require special promotions or cost-effective marketing campaigns to engage.

**2. Optimal Number of Clusters (K) Selection**
Used the Elbow Method to determine the ideal number of clusters. The optimal K value was found to be 4, balancing interpretability and model efficiency.

**3. Visual Representation of Clusters:**
Data was visualized using scatter plots to clearly distinguish customer segments. Color-coded clustering helped in understanding spending patterns at a glance.

### Business Impact & Recommendations

ðŸ“Œ **Revenue Growth:** By identifying high-value customers, businesses can create strategies to maximize sales and profitability.

ðŸ“Œ **Targeted Promotions:** Premium shoppers can be engaged with exclusive offers, while impulse buyers respond better to discounts and flash sales.

ðŸ“Œ **Customer Retention Strategies:** Loyalty programs can encourage cautious spenders to increase their spending habits.

ðŸ“Œ **Improved Sales Forecasting:** Understanding customer behavior enables more accurate revenue predictions and inventory management.
